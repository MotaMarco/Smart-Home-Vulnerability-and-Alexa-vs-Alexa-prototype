# Smart-Home-Vulnerability-and-Alexa-vs-Alexa-prototype
This repository is an extension of my educational paper focused on the pressing privacy and security concerns in the realm of smart homes. The aim is to shed light on the critical issues users face and to offer insight into enhancing the security and privacy of smart home ecosystems.

What's Inside:
--Understanding Smart Homes: Dive into the world of smart homes, exploring their advantages and potential risks. This section provides a balanced view of what it means to incorporate smart technology into daily life.

--Security Analysis: A thorough discussion on various vulnerabilities that smart home devices face. We'll cover different types of attacks these devices are susceptible to and the tools that can be used to exploit these weaknesses.

--Mitigation Strategies: Learn about effective measures and steps that can be taken to bolster the security of smart homes. This part is crucial for users seeking to safeguard their digital and personal privacy.

--User Responsibility: Explore the concept of 'User Perceptions of Responsibility' where we delve into users' viewpoints on who should be accountable for the security issues in smart home devices and discuss potential solutions.

--Alexa vs Alexa Prototype: The highlight of this project is the detailed examination and my unique development of the Alexa vs Alexa vulnerability prototype. This section underscores the severity of this security flaw and presents my improvement on one of the attack phases, demonstrating the attack's feasibility.

This project is designed to inform and educate users, developers, and enthusiasts about the importance of privacy and security in smart homes.
